## A mental health awareness app powered by node.js, express and handlebars

Mental health in young people is an extremely big problem as in the UK 40% of all young people will suffer from mental health promblems some time in their life.

We aimed to change this by creating an web app that allowed us to raise awareness of mental health of young people. This app was created at the Youth Hack #8, part of the HacManchester program, we entered this app for the federation challenge which was: `to create a digital solution for social challanges faced by people in the North of England and the UK as a whole`, a challange that we ended up winning with this solution.
